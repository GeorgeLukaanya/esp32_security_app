## 🚀 Features Breakdown

### **1. Risk Level Assessment** 🎯
```
LOW:    ✅ < 2 fire alerts AND < 10 total alerts
MEDIUM: ⚠️  2-5 fire alerts OR 10-20 total alerts  
HIGH:   🔴 > 5 fire alerts OR > 20 total alerts
```
**Helps users quickly understand system safety status**

### **2. Timeline Graph** 📈
- **X-axis:** Hours (0-23)
- **Y-axis:** Alert count
- **Lines:**
  - 🔥 Red line = Fire alerts
  - 🧲 Blue line = Magnetic alerts
- **Shows:** Patterns, clusters, peak times

**Identifies:** Which hours are most dangerous, anomalies

### **3. Statistics Dashboard** 📊
```
Total Alerts        → Overall count
🔥 Fire Alerts      → Fire-specific count
🧲 Magnetic Alerts  → Magnetic-specific count
Peak Alert Time     → When most alerts occur (e.g., 14:00)
Average Gap         → Minutes between alerts
Trend               → % change from previous day (+40% = increasing)
```

### **4. Time Period Selection** ⏱️
- **Today** - Shows hourly breakdown + timeline graph
- **Week** - Shows aggregated statistics for last 7 days
- **Month** - Shows aggregated statistics for current month

## 💡 How to Use

### **From Settings Screen:**
1. Open app → Tap ⚙️ Settings
2. Tap "📊 View Analytics & Insights" button
3. Select period: Today / Week / Month
4. View statistics and timeline

### **What the Data Tells You:**

**Example Scenario 1: Normal System**
```
Today's Analytics:
Risk: 🟢 LOW
Total: 3 alerts (1 fire, 2 magnetic)
Peak Time: 09:00
Avg Gap: 120 minutes
Trend: -50% (improving!)

→ Interpretation: System is stable, few incidents
```

**Example Scenario 2: Problem Detected**
```
Today's Analytics:
Risk: 🔴 HIGH
Total: 28 alerts (22 fire, 6 magnetic)
Peak Time: 14:30 (concentrated)
Avg Gap: 3 minutes (clustered)
Trend: +200% (rapidly increasing!)

→ Interpretation: Fire alerts clustering at 2:30 PM
   → Check furnace/heat source area at that time
```
